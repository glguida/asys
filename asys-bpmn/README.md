# Workflow component

The BPMN component coordinates ordinary jobs in a selected environment. It
supports branching, parallel work, revision loops, Human decisions and explicit
recovery. Launch every workflow through the shared `asys-run` command:

```sh
asys-run ./env/development ./workflow.bpmn --input request.md --workspace ./project
asys-run --resume RUN
asys status RUN
asys top RUN
asys dashboard
```

An input file becomes the literal `request` string. `--process ID` selects an
executable process. `--name NAME` labels the run. `--human` attaches a private
Human terminal for that workflow. The environment and workspace must exist;
workspace defaults to the current directory. Run state is separate from both.

## Author and validate

Use the [authoring guide](AUTHORING.md) and the portable
[asys-authoring skill](../skills/asys-authoring/SKILL.md). A bound task selects an
exact `workers.json.types` key. Named agentic workers receive
`{request: request}`; programs and Human tasks receive their native JSON input.
The worker kind comes from its definition, not the BPMN task's visual type.

The [hello](examples/hello/README.md) and
[shared workspace](examples/shared-workspace/README.md) examples need no model.
The [mixed review](examples/mixed-review/README.md) example combines an agent,
two swarms, a goal, a program, a Senate and Human acceptance or revision.

## Execution and recovery

Each run owns a workflow component and workers component. Referenced worlds are
prepared separately before jobs start. Jobs share the actual workspace and get
separate evidence directories. Runtime executes them; BPMN controls ordering.
Parallel writers should own distinct files and join before consuming results.

A negative review is an ordinary successful result. Route it through a gateway.
A failing program or agent exception is an activity error; catch it with an
appropriate boundary event or let the run fail. The graph and conditions must
express acceptance, revision and stopping explicitly.

`asys-run --resume RUN` loads the saved run, rebuilds its selected environment,
and retries interrupted or failed work in fresh jobs. It retains the workspace,
completed results and execution evidence. Do not supply a new workflow,
environment, workspace or model during resume. Checkpoint engine compatibility
is checked before recovery. Resume is not a general migration between versions.

The root contains `run.json`, `run.log`, the saved workflow, runtime records and
job evidence. `asys logs` reads process output; `asys top` and the dashboard read agent
sessions. The dashboard computes layout from actual saved edges and exposes
all jobs, including programs and Human tasks.

## Embedding

The component exports `asys.workflow.v1.Workflow`. The
[protobuf contract](proto/asys/workflow/v1/workflow.proto) defines loading,
checking, execution, status, cancellation, messages, events and recovery.
The [engine contract](ENGINE.md) documents adapter compatibility.
The filesystem host channel uses the runtime's atomic Reader/Writer transport.
Its start/resume/cancel/message requests belong to an embedding API; there is no
separate public workflow host executable.

## Development

`make build` builds the workflow and worker images. `make install` installs the
shared host commands. `npm test` covers engine behavior and host integration
fixtures; `tools/integration-test` checks real dcomp containers, programs, Pi
adapter fixtures, Human protocol and launcher recovery without paid model calls.
`make test-upstream-drift` checks newer upstream engine assumptions separately.
