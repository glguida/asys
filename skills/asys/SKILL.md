description: Run and inspect asys workers and workflows, configure inference and model defaults, answer human requests, and recover failed workflow runs. Use for operating an existing asys project. Use asys-authoring to create environments, workers, worlds, workflows or dashboard designs.

# Operate asys

Public execution goes through `asys-run`, including BPMN workflows. Component
names such as `asys-bpmn` identify implementation packages, not separate host
launch commands. Use the installed command help and these bundled references.

## Select the setup

Identify four independent selections before starting work:

- Environment: Dockerfile, component interfaces, worker definitions and tools.
- Workspace: existing project files that jobs read and modify directly.
- State directory: saved runs, inference, Human state and model defaults.
- System: dcomp namespace containing components and shared endpoints.

`--root` selects the asys state directory. Defaults are `ASYS_STATE_ROOT`, then
`XDG_STATE_HOME/asys`, then `~/.local/state/asys`. Load a project's `asys-env`
when provided; it also selects dcomp state. Observation can read records from
several systems in one state directory.

## Execute and inspect

```sh
asys-workers list ENVIRONMENT
asys-workers describe ENVIRONMENT WORKER
asys-run ENVIRONMENT WORKER "Assignment" --workspace PROJECT
asys-run ENVIRONMENT workflow.bpmn --input request.md --workspace PROJECT
asys status latest
asys logs latest
asys dashboard
```

Use actual project paths and names. Check required services and models before a
model run. Program-only work need not use inference. Stay within the authorized
scope; inspection does not require starting paid or externally mutating work.

Read the recorded failure before retrying. `asys-run --resume RUN` restores a
workflow's saved definition and workspace; partial edits persist. Model output
is not proof that acceptance criteria passed: inspect artifacts and checks.

Answer human tasks through the Human service. Present the recorded question and
evidence, obtain the person's answer, and submit it. Do not invent approval to
complete a demonstration. The dashboard inspects evidence; the terminal handler
accepts answers.
