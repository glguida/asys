# Commands and options

## Execution and authoring

```text
asys-run ENVIRONMENT WORKER [REQUEST] [OPTIONS]
asys-run ENVIRONMENT WORKFLOW.bpmn [REQUEST] [OPTIONS]
asys-run --resume RUN [--root DIRECTORY] [--human]
asys-workers list ENVIRONMENT [--json]
asys-workers add ENVIRONMENT KIND NAME [--file FILE]
asys-workers describe ENVIRONMENT NAME
asys-workers edit ENVIRONMENT NAME
asys-environment add-skill ENVIRONMENT SKILLDIR
asys-environment dockerfile ENVIRONMENT FILE
asys-environment edit ENVIRONMENT [FILE]
```

`KIND` is `agent`, `goal`, `senate` or `swarm`. `add --help` explains generated
files and configuration. Describe prints JSON. Edit uses `VISUAL` or `EDITOR`
and validates before replacement. Environment commands edit source files and
take no state-root option.

`REQUEST` is literal text. `--input FILE` reads UTF-8 text instead; `-` reads
stdin. JSON-looking text remains text. A named worker requires a request;
a workflow may omit it if its tasks do not use the `request` variable.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--workspace DIRECTORY` | Existing project directory; default current directory |
| `--root DIRECTORY` | Asys state directory; this run is saved under `runs/` |
| `--name NAME` | Run display name |
| `--input FILE` | Request file or stdin; cannot accompany positional REQUEST |
| `--model MODEL` | Named-worker model override; configure workflow models in definitions |
| `--parameters FILE` | Named-worker JSON parameters: agent `maxSteps`, goal `maxAttempts` |
| `--process ID` | Select an executable process in a BPMN document |
| `--human` | Workflow terminal with a private Human service; also valid on resume |
| `--system NAME` | Dcomp namespace; default `asys` |
| `--dcomp-state-root DIRECTORY` | Dcomp state; default `DCOMP_STATE_ROOT` or dcomp default |
| `--runtime-root DIRECTORY` | Dcomp proxy/socket directory; default chosen by dcomp |
| `-L INPUT=TARGET`, `--link INPUT=TARGET` | Repeatable input connection: `COMPONENT.OUTPUT`, `@GLOBAL`, or `-` |

Resume restores saved configuration and accepts only `--root` and `--human`.
It rejects a new environment, workspace, request, model, system or connection.
Stdin cannot supply both `--input -` and interactive `--human` answers.

## Configuration and observation

```text
asys init DIRECTORY [--dcomp DIRECTORY] [--group GROUP]
asys update [--root DIRECTORY]
asys system-model set simple MODEL [--root DIRECTORY]
asys system-model list [--json] [--root DIRECTORY]
asys ps [--json] [--root DIRECTORY]
asys status [RUN] [--json] [--root DIRECTORY]
asys logs [RUN] [JOB] [--source SOURCE] [--stream STREAM] [-f] [-n N] [--root DIRECTORY]
asys top [RUN] [--root DIRECTORY]
asys dashboard [--port PORT] [--design DIRECTORY] [--root DIRECTORY]
asys skill [DEST] [--name asys|asys-authoring]
```

`RUN` accepts an ID, unique prefix, `latest`, or saved run directory. `JOB`
accepts a name, ID or unique prefix. An omitted run selects the latest applicable
run; `ps` lists saved runs.

Log sources: `run`, `events`, `jobs`, `components`, `commands`. A JOB or stream
selects `jobs`; streams are `stdout`, `stderr`, `both`. Default output is the
full run log or 50 lines per worker/component log. `-n 0 -f` follows new output.

`asys skill` prints bundled paths; `--name` selects one. DEST is the parent skill
directory. Without `--name`, both `DEST/asys` and `DEST/asys-authoring` are copied
with references and templates. Existing copies are preserved and reported as
an error. Exported copies are snapshots, independent of later installation updates.

## Shared state semantics

`--root` selects the same asys directory for execution, observation, inference
and human host commands. It can precede or follow command arguments. Precedence:
explicit option, `ASYS_STATE_ROOT`, `XDG_STATE_HOME/asys`, `~/.local/state/asys`.
Each service uses its own subdirectory beneath that root.

`asys init` takes the directory positionally. Authoring takes an environment;
skill export reads the installed bundle. These do not take `--root`.

One root can hold runs from several dcomp systems. `--system` does not create a
new root. Inference saves its system and dcomp paths at `init`; later commands
reuse them. Runners must use matching settings to reach its shared endpoint.
