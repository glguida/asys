# Worker definitions

Every named definition is a version-1 JSON object with `kind`, `config`, and an
optional `description`. Its filename supplies the worker name. `asys-workers
add ENVIRONMENT KIND NAME --file FILE` validates and imports a complete definition.
Imported assets must be supplied separately; swarm import does not scaffold a world.

Standalone runs and workflow bindings use the same input:

```json
{"request":"Check the implementation against its specification","parameters":{}}
```

The built-in `simple` and `goal` are available for standalone runs without source
mutations. An environment definition or ordinary command with the same name takes
precedence. Workflow types must be explicitly declared in `workers.json`.

## Agent

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "kind": "agent",
  "description": "Edit the assigned project files and check the result.",
  "config": {"agent": "editor", "maxSteps": 30}
}
```

`agent` selects `agents/editor/`; write its prompt there. Optional `model` selects
an exported model ID. Otherwise the `simple` system-model default applies.
`system: true` is supported only with `agent: "simple"` for the bundled prompt.
`parameters.maxSteps` overrides the definition's positive step limit for one job.

An agent reports a JSON object with nonempty `final` and `exception: null` or a
nonempty blocker. Request any additional fields needed downstream, including
their types. A review can return `approved: false` with `exception: null`.

## Goal

```json
{"version":1,"kind":"goal","config":{"maxAttempts":4}}
```

The request is the objective and governing criteria. The implementation agent
keeps a conversation across work turns; `goal_status: "continue"` continues work,
and `goal_status: "review"` asks an independent verifier to check it. Verification
receives the objective, workspace, open findings and human guidance, without the
implementer's completion narrative. Only verification completes the goal.

Optional `model` selects a model. Omitting `maxAttempts` leaves attempts unlimited;
the limit counts successful implementation turns, including `continue`.
`parameters.maxAttempts` overrides it for one job. Blockers can ask Human for
retry, correction or abort. A retry retains implementation context and starts
fresh verification. Ordinary worker timeout remains a separate process limit.

## Senate

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "kind": "senate",
  "config": {
    "version": 1,
    "princeps": {"name": "Marcus", "prompt": "Coordinate the discussion and state the supported decision."},
    "senators": [
      {"name": "Seasoned engineer", "prompt": "Assess implementation choices and maintenance costs."},
      {"name": "Numerical analyst", "prompt": "Check numerical assumptions, bounds and calculations."},
      {"name": "Verification engineer", "prompt": "Inspect actual tests and challenge unsupported claims."}
    ]
  }
}
```

The optional `prompt` is also the place for a short personality paragraph. It
steers this participant's temperament, reasoning style and interaction with
others, separately from their name and the current assignment. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Numerical analyst",
  "prompt": "You are patient, precise, and quietly skeptical. Prefer small counterexamples and quantitative bounds. Challenge unsupported claims without becoming combative, and readily change your position when the evidence warrants it."
}
```

The paragraph is included in that participant's instructions throughout the
discussion. The princeps accepts the same field. Combine the character with a
concrete professional responsibility; do not replace the task's acceptance
criteria with a persona. Use `agent` to reuse a larger environment definition.

Participant names must be unique. Each may supply `prompt`, `agent` assets and
`model`. The princeps senatus coordinates; the configured name remains Marcus
in this example. Senators carry professional roles. Ask for the structured
decision fields the workflow needs rather than assuming every decision supplies
an `approved` field. The result belongs to the Senate job; individual contributions
and phases remain inspectable separately.

## Swarm

```sh
asys-workers add ./env/research swarm search
```

The starter creates a named swarm, `search-step` member command, member prompt,
and `worlds/search/` package. Configure its evaluator and world settings before
running. The initial evaluator deliberately rejects unconfigured work.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "kind": "swarm",
  "config": {
    "version": 1,
    "world": {"package": "worlds/search", "settings": {"top_k": 0, "problem": {"initial": {}}}},
    "agents": {"count": 4, "type": "search-step"},
    "limits": {"turns": 20, "decisions": 80}
  }
}
```

The run request becomes the mission. Member commands execute observations and
return actions and private memory. The separate world component determines
admissibility, transitions and measured success. Reaching a turn or decision
limit does not establish the objective was achieved. Read evaluation metrics.

Named swarm definitions use `world.package`; runtime channels are assigned per
job. Neither `world.command` nor host module imports belong in this definition.
Senate and swarm currently accept no per-job `parameters` fields. Change their
named configuration to change participants, worlds or search limits.
